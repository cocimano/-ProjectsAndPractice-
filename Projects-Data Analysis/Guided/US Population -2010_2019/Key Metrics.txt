Key metrics selected for this app
The primary question this population dashboard aims to answer is: how do US state populations change over time?

What questions do we need to ask that will help us answer this dashboard goal?

-How do total populations compare among different states?
-How do state populations evolve over time and how do they compare to each other?
-In a given year, which states experienced more than 50,000 people moving in, or out? 
 We'll label these inbound and outbound migration metrics.
